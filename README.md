# Password-Generator
This is an application for generating complex passwords using simple ones for windows 7 and later , 64bit.
Download the folder and double-click 'newPsurgery.exe' to run.
Step 1. enter a simple password, eg. hello
Step 2. enter a sand eg. thisyearis2020
Final password would be: RcD9JNT9H'
Save simple passwords in a file, never save the sand anywhere. 
This way, final passwords would be complicated enough but we can always just memorize simple ones.
